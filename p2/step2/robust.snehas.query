<title>movies in Cannes film festival</title>
<desc>What are the movies that have been chosen for the Cannes film festival in the past and what kind of movies usually get selected?</desc>
<narr>I want to know what the Cannes film festival is about, what sort of movies get selected and a list of movies that were selected. I also want to know why Cannes film festival is worth attending for a film fanatic. I would not consider newspaper articles which refer to the film festival in passing as relevant. The document must have some data related to the movies that are played in the film festival. The mention of the name of a movie that has appeared or is going to appear in the film festival can make it relevant. </narr>
