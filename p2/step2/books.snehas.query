<desc>I want to know about Marie Curie and her discovery of radium</desc>
<narr>I am interested to know about how Marie Curie discovered radium, her research methodology, when she happened to do so. I also want to know what experiment she was conducting when she discovered radium. I do not consider articles which refer to radium and it's properties, or articles that merely mention 'Oh hey Marie Curie discovered Radium' as relevant. There must be some aspect about the discovery in the document for it to be relevant</narr>
