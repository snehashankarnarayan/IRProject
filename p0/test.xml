Then they called upon him with loud</line><line>cries to stand forward; and so, putting him twenty</line><line>paces in front, they advanced. Halting within thirty</line><line>paces of the enemy, he rested his musket against his</line><line>cheek and aimed at one of the chiefs. The musket</line><line>a short weapon, then called an arquebus was loaded</line><line>with four balls. Two chiefs fell dead, and another man</line><line>was mortally wounded.

The</line><line>courage of the whole band gave way, and when an</line><line>other Frenchman fired a shot from the woods, they</line><line>all turned and fled precipitately, abandoning camp</line><line>and provisions a whole tribe, and that one of the</line><line>bravest, routed by two shots from French muskets.</line><line>This was in July, 1609.</line></section></region><region><section id="0" key="4491" label="SEC_BODY"><line>On his voyage of the following year he also taught</line><line>the same Indians how to attack a fortified place.</line><line>Until that time their warlike training had taught</line><line>them only how to track a single enemy or to elude</line><line>him ; or at most, gathered in solid masses, to pour in</line><line>showers of arrows furnished with those sharp stone</line><line>heads so familiar in our collections.

With these was soon as</line><line>sociated Ohio (1802), and then no other was added</line><line>until a vast acquisition of territory made it neces</line><line>sary. This was the province of Louisiana, which was</line><line>obtained by Jefferson through one of those strokes</line><line>of glaring inconsistency which his opponents called</line><line>trick and his admirers statesmanship. Monroe had</line><line>been sent to France to buy the Floridas and the isl</line><line>and of New Orleans, but he went beyond his instruc</line><line>tions, and paid fifteen millions (April 30, 1803) for all</line><line>the vast region then called Louisiana, comprising the</line><line>island of New Orleans and all the continent west of</line><line>the Mississippi River between the British possessions</line><line>and what was then Mexico. The territory thus ob</line><line>tained was afterwards assumed to have extended to</line><line>the Pacific Ocean, although this was a claim subject</line><line>to much doubt. It was a most important acquisition</line><line>which more than doubled the original area of the</line><line>United States, and saved it from being hemmed in</line><line>between English Canada and French Florida. But</line><line>here was a test of those rigid doctrines with which</line><line>Jefferson was identified of State rights and the strict</line><line>construction of the Constitution. If the resolutions</line><line>which he had drawn up for the State of Kentucky were</line><line>true, then the purchase of Louisiana was wrong, for</line><line>it was the exercise of a power not given by the Con</line><line>stitution, and it strengthened the nation enormously</line><line>at the expense of the original States. Jeflerson sus</line><line>tained it simply on the ground that the people needed</line><line>it, and if they did so, a constitutional amendment</line><line>would set all right. In other words, he violated</line><line>what he himself had declared to be law, and suggested</line><line>that a new law be passed to confirm his action.

Some of these colonies were, moreover,</line><line>trying the unprofitable experiment of Indian slavery</line><line>as well.
